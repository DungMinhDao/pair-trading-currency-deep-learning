# WQU Capstone Project: Enhancing Pair Trading Strategies for Currency Pairs Using Deep Learning Models

# Problem Statement
To identify opportunities, traditional pair trading strategies often rely on statistical tools like cointegration and mean reversion. These methods assume linear relationships and stable dynamics, but markets—especially the fast-moving forex market—frequently exhibit nonlinear behaviors and structural shifts that challenge those assumptions. Our project aims to develop a deep learning-driven framework to detect and exploit short-term deviations in a synthetic EUR/USD and other currency pairs’ spread, utilizing neural networks to uncover hidden temporal patterns and nonlinear dynamics, thereby enhancing the profitability and resilience of long/short pair trading strategies.

# Code
The code is currently in the committed IPython Notebook file. The file on Google Colab is also accessible [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1TctfiBYEhWehlVWe3qZgFIM5_EYYM4CS?usp=sharing)
